# Wizza Theme
Wizza is a dark theme for Visual Studio Code. The dark background provides a pleasant contrast. Specially optimized for HTML, CSS and Javascript coding.

## How to install:
Using the Extensions menu, search for **Wizza**. Don't forget to apply the theme (see below).
Press `ctrl(⌘) + k`, then press `ctrl(⌘) + t`, you will see a theme selection interface. Choose 'Wizza'.

Wizza has been forked from [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) and inspired by [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme).

**Enjoy!**
